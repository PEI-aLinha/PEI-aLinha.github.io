## Content

Content is stored in `src/content/`:

- `docs/` — project documents and references

- `team/` — students, advisors and collaborators

See [`CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.md`](./CONTENT_MANAGEMENT.md) for Pages CMS instructions.

## Meeting minutes

Minutes support three modes through frontmatter:

```yaml
mode: markdown # website version
mode: pdf      # PDF-only
mode: hybrid   # website + PDF
pdf: /documents/minutes/minute-02.pdf
```

PDFs uploaded through Pages CMS are stored under `public/documents/`.

## Team photos

Student photos can be uploaded through Pages CMS and are stored under `public/images/team/`.
The public Team page reserves a large portrait area for each student. Advisors and collaborators
use a text-only layout.

## Visual identity

The microsite keeps the existing aLinha alignment motif and uses:

- warm paper — base canvas
- petroleum — primary brand / aligned state
- terracotta — restrained signal / misalignment accent

The sponsor strip, map footer and navbar interaction style from the original microsite are retained.
